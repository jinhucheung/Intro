Intro brings your rails application to new feature introduction and step-by-step users guide.

Intro injects dynamically-generated [Shepherd.js](https://github.com/shipshapecode/shepherd) code into your application whenever user should see a guided tour.

+ Define tour content in a backstage.
+ Tour content supports image, many languages.
+ Easy to change tours styles or add a theme.
+ Play nicely with Turbolinks.
+ Friendly to non-developers.

## Demo

[Demo](https://intro-demo.herokuapp.com/): [Source](https://github.com/jinhucheung/intro-demo)

## Installation

Add `intro` to application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'intro'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

Copy migrations and configurations:

```
$ rails generate intro:install
```

Then do migrate:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

### Inserting assets into view

Insert `intro_tags` into common layout, just before the closing body tag:

```
<%= intro_tags %>
</body>
</html>
```

`intro_tags` imports assets of intro and adds `_intro` global variable with options.

**Note**: `intro_tags` must be inserted into body tag for refreshing `_intro` variable if you need to use Turbolinks.

### Adding tour in backstage

Visit `http://localhost:3000/intro/admin` to backstage after starting server. In `config/initializers/intro.rb` file, you can get the default username and password for logining.

Then add tour and define content. After filling out the content, you need to publish tour.

### Customizing tour style

If the default style doesn't satisfy you, you need to run assets generator:

```
$ rails generate intro:assets
```

Then you would get the asset files:

```
app/javascript/stylesheets/intro/shepherd/_variables.scss
app/javascript/stylesheets/intro/shepherd/base.scss
```

Change them for your need.

### Configuring intro

see `config/initializers/intro.rb` for detail configuration.
